# Distracted-Driver-Detection
Distracted driver detection is a critical application of computer vision and machine learning techniques aimed at identifying instances of driver distraction while operating a vehicle. By analyzing visual cues from in-car cameras or other sensors, the goal is to classify the driver's behavior into different distraction categories, such as texting, talking on the phone, eating, or any other activity that diverts their attention from the road.

The process of distracted driver detection typically involves the following steps:

Data Collection: A dataset of driver images or videos is collected, capturing the driver's face and their activities inside the vehicle. The dataset should include examples of both distracted and non-distracted driving behaviors, and it needs to be appropriately labeled for training purposes.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to enhance its quality and prepare it for analysis. This step may involve image resizing, cropping, normalization, and noise reduction techniques. It may also include extracting the region of interest (ROI) to focus on the driver's face or hands.

Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed data. This can be achieved using various techniques, such as traditional computer vision algorithms or deep learning-based approaches. For instance, facial landmarks or hand gestures may be detected to capture specific behaviors associated with distraction.

Model Development: Machine learning models, particularly deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are trained on the extracted features to classify the driver's behavior. The models are trained using the labeled dataset, where the input is the extracted features, and the output is the distraction category.

Model Evaluation and Optimization: The trained model is evaluated using a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are calculated to measure the model's effectiveness. Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization techniques may be employed to improve the performance of the model.

Deployment and Real-Time Application: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed in real-time systems or integrated into vehicles. In-car cameras or other sensors capture live data, and the trained model analyzes it to detect instances of driver distraction. Alerts or warnings can be generated to notify the driver or trigger automated actions to mitigate the risk of accidents.

It's worth noting that distracted driver detection is an active research area, and advancements in computer vision, deep learning, and sensor technology are continuously improving the accuracy and robustness of these systems.
